## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "File not found in storage"
- **Cause**: File references exist but actual files were deleted
- **Solution**: This is handled gracefully - submission continues without missing files
- **Result**: Warning logged but doesn't stop submission

### Issue: "Failed to submit RFQ"
- **Cause**: Network/browser issues preventing download
- **Solution**: Refresh page and try again
- **Backup**: Data is saved locally in browser storage

### Issue: Download doesn't start
- **Cause**: Browser blocking downloads
- **Solution**: Check browser download settings
- **Alternative**: Open browser console, look for download link
